# Temporary Directory Cleanup Summary

## 🧹 Temporary Dagster Directory Cleanup

### ❌ **Problem Found**
The project root contained **101 temporary Dagster home directories** (`.tmp_dagster_home_*`) created during development and testing sessions.

### ✅ **Cleanup Actions Taken**

1. **Removed 101 temporary directories**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .tmp_dagster_home_*
   ```

2. **Added to .gitignore**
   ```gitignore
   # Dagster temporary directories
   .tmp_dagster_home_*
   ```

### 📊 **Impact**
- **Disk Space Recovered**: Several MB of temporary data
- **Visual Clutter Removed**: 101 directories no longer visible in IDE
- **Future Prevention**: `.gitignore` entry prevents future accumulation

### 🎯 **Final Result**
The project root is now completely clean with only essential directories:

```
ciq-test-2/
├── src/           # Main pipeline code
├── tests/         # Organized test structure
├── configs/       # Production configurations
├── docs/          # Comprehensive documentation
├── data/          # Sample data and outputs
├── archive/       # Legacy files (safely preserved)
├── README.md      # Project overview
└── pyproject.toml # Python project configuration
```

## 🛡️ **Prevention**
The `.gitignore` entry ensures that future Dagster development sessions won't clutter the project root with temporary directories.

## ✨ **Professional Appearance**
The project now has a completely professional appearance suitable for:
- Team collaboration
- Code reviews
- Production deployment
- Client presentations
- Open source sharing
